Can you tell, from the top of your head, which color is `#A200FF`? What about `rgba(0, 255, 39)`? If a button would receive a darker tone of this first HEX with some *:hover* effect, which HEX would you provide to reach that tone?  

Now imagine that same button receiving a prop called *:disabled* by any external condition which may turn it opaque, which color should you use? By transforming the __HEX__ into some __RGBa__ in order to use it's transparency hability? If that's so, let's talk about HSL, it's gonna be a blast for you.  

## __HEX and RGB aren't intuitive at all__  

Answering some of questions above, `#A200FF` stands for some purple tone, while `rgba(0, 255, 39)` is a clear green. To reach a brighter purple, you can use `#CA6EFF`, or even `#DDA1FF`. You can also use `#5A008C` to get a darker tone for that same purple.  

But shouldn't that be easier? I mean, we're just talking about light getting in and out over a color when it comes to have it brighter or darker. But to get things done with both __HEX__ and __RGB__ we need to update __all the values in there__, getting a totally new code just in order to change the color brightness.

There's no clear relationship between `#A200FF`, `#DDA1FF` and `#5A008C`. Without any previous context, it's near impossible to say that they're just different tones of the same color.

> To get a RGB from HEX you just need to split the HEX in three couples, and then apply the following formula on each of them: *(x\*16 + y\*1)*, where __x__ is the first and __y__ is the second value. For example:

> = [ 221, 161, 255 ]  
> rgb(221, 161, 255)

> Yay, it's done!

## __BEHOLD: The HSL color model__  

HSL stands for *Hue*, *Saturation*, *Light*, a model that's way more intuitive than RGB or HEX. And you can use this model within your CSS following this syntax:  

`hsl(hue saturation% light%)`  

Beyond those three properties, there's also a fourth, the secret one called *Alpha*, which is used to handle transparency.

*Hue* is like the color wheel, the color itself on it's angular position, which can receives values from 0 to 359. *Saturation* is how much intense the color is presented, can hold values from 0% to 100%. *Light*, like the name suggests, is how much brightness the color will receive, and it also hold values from 0% to 100%.

So, following the __HSL__ model, you just need to worry about the *Hue*, because both *Saturation* and *Light* would be applied directly over it. For example:  

- The *hue* value from that previous purple HEX (#A200FF), is __278__
- A purple HSL background: `background-color: hsl(278 100% 50%);`
- In order to make it less intense, you can just change it's *saturation*: `background-color: hsl(278 50% 50%);`
- Otherwise, to make it darker, you can just change it's *light* value: `background-color: hsl(278 100% 35%);`
- You can also follow it's secret value *alpha* to play with transparency: `background-color: hsl(278 100% 50% / 0.5);`

Can you feel the readability improvement over there? Looks good, right?

From here to the moon, witchcraft like [dynamic themes with calc() and HSL](https://css-tricks.com/creating-color-themes-with-custom-properties-hsl-and-a-little-calc/) and even [change the color of some text following it's background](https://css-tricks.com/switch-font-color-for-different-backgrounds-with-css/) are easier to learn and cast.

See you next time! üëãüèæ
