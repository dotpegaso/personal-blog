Recently I realize that *a11y* is a numeronym for the "accessibility" word, representing the count of letters between the letter `a` and `y`. The same goes for *l10n*, which stands for `localization`, *g11n* for `globalization`, *i18n* for `internationalization`, [and on and on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym#:~:text=A%20numeronym%20is%20a%20number,canine%2C%20relating%20to%20dogs%22).

 I believe it's normal to think about people with special needs when we talk about web accessibility - like using screen readers, text-to-speech, and stuff. But how much do we consider how accessibility also improves the user experience for those without special needs?

 Making a web application accessible is not just about helping users with special needs. It actually makes things more user-friendly for everyone and brings other benefits to the app itself.

That's said, I believe it's interesting to look at accessibility as something ordinary, without the special requirements lenses.

## __Okay cool, where do I start?__

I think the [a11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com) is a fantastic starting point to delve deeper into the topic, especially because of its awesome organization of *WCAG COMPLIANCE* in a [checklist format](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/#content).

If you, like me, use React daily, [this egghead.io course](https://egghead.io/courses/develop-accessible-web-apps-with-react) can be a great technical starting point.

## __And how to understand the tools behind a11y?__

The W3C itself offers [this great page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/) with tools and techniques for accessibility. There, you can find examples of technologies used to adapt different strategies, such as voice browsers, volume control, eye tracking, and more.

From there, you'll discover a whole new world that will make you start thinking more about how to improve your applications to remove barriers and enhance the experience for everyone, whether they have special needs or not. Embracing accessibility becomes a way to create a more inclusive and user-friendly experience for all.

See you next time! üëãüèæ
